The Human Universal Measurement and Assessment Network Laboratory (HUMAN) Lab uses 
a comprehensive measurement and assessment approach to provide performance optimization 
and mitigation recommendations that are based on a thorough understanding of the complexities 
that exist in contextually rich activities. The HUMAN Laboratory is equipped with a state-of-
the-art multimodal data acquisition system, including sensors to monitor brain, heart, muscle-
activity, eye movement, respiration, galvanic skin response and other body signals. This data 
is collected and analyzed along with performance data to compile a comprehensive picture of 
drivers that may affect operator workload and decision making ability. This understanding will
provide opportunities to implement performance augmentations or mitigations to alleviate any 
bottlenecks. The efforts of the HUMAN Lab will ultimately enable Warfighters to optimize 
performance and successfully accomplish their missions by alleviating cognitive overload.
