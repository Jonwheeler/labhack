The LabHack hackathon sold out <strong>59 days in advance</strong>. We have attendees and volunteers from across the United States and Canada. It's gonna be a blast!

We're considering opening up a Saturday Day Pass to allow others to attend. We want to allow people to attend while keeping the event fun for everyone. For this reason, we're asking for your feedback on "Day Passes". <em>Please vote!</em>

A Saturday Day Pass would provide:

* Admission to all workshops starting at noon
* Lunch and Dinner included
* Swag and ability to talk with any on-site vendors
