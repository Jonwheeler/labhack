Mr. Bob Lee started work in the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory as a research physicist in 1974. His team developed the noise and sonic boom models that are used DoD wide today. As a branch
chief in the consolidated Armstrong Laboratory he led the efforts to quantify the effects of noise and sonic boom on people, animals, and structures. His work led to the developing definitive solutions that were critical in establishing the Valentine-Reserve Supersonic Military Operating Area after the AF was bogged down in an 8 year legal battle. In 2003 he led a team that responded to Dr. Rocheâ€™s, the Secretary of the Air Force, challenge to AFRL to improve targeting and reduce Fratricide for Air Force Combat Controllers by developing the BATMAN program for AFRL Human Effectiveness Directorate. This highly innovative program connected technologies from 4 directorates, laid the foundation for an order of magnitude improvement in targeting time, and cut out virtually all human introduced errors in the targeting process. During his 32 year career in AFRL, Bob, consistently innovated on technology and processes to leap the technology gap and field systems that are in use in the USAF and DoD today. Currently Bob is the Open Innovation Award Challenge manager for AFRL at the Wright Brothers Institute-IDEA lab assisting AFRL employees in this new process for reaching out to the world to solve their technical and functional problems.
