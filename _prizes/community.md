Participants and volunteers can vote and give feedback on projects using [hackathon.io](http://www.hackathon.io/afrl/submissions/judge) during the presentations just like the official judges. Scores are anonymous and comments will go back to the team under review.

As prizes, we'll be giving away some goodies donated by the Dayton Dragons and O'Reilly Media.
