Github is offering the top three Air Force Challenge teams the following [Github plans](https://github.com/plans) as prizes: 

* Grand prize: 1 year of [Silver plan](https://github.com/plans)
* Second place: 1 year of [Bronze plan](https://github.com/plans)
* Third place: 6 months of [Bronze plan](https://github.com/plans)

Our Git trainer, Matthew, put together [a brief tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxvRP5gwhA) on using an organization account during a hackathon.

Please note, the prizes are per team, not per individual on a team. If, for some reason, a team wishes to have individual prizes instead (e.g. if they are not continuing with the project), then Github can set this up. [Winners must be redeem codes at Github](https://github.com/redeem) **before October 31, 2015**.
